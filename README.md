## Written Analysis
After reading through the school data, there are a few points that initially jump out. When broken down by the top performing and bottom performing schools on a percentage-passing basis, the top schools all happen to be charter schools while the bottom all happen to be district. This is supported further by the breakdown of grades between charter and district schools toward the end of the analysis. My first thought was that the charter schools would have higher budgets, leading to more dollars spent on each student, leading to higher grades when compared to the district schools. However, when looking at the amount spent per student, grades fall (across the board) as spending rises. The biggest indicator from this data seems to be the size of the school. Small and medium schools (those with fewer than 2,000 students) vastly outperform large schools (those with over 2,000 students) by about 30 percentage points on an overall basis. 

Although small and medium schools have significantly higher average grades than large schools, we cannot definitively say that they are “better” schools based on the data provided. We do not know the rigor of the coursework across the schools, nor do we know the leniency or “grade inflation” that may or may not be occurring within each school. Standardized testing along with other subjective analyses may be able to provide a fuller picture.
